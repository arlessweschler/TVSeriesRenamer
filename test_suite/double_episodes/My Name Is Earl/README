Some series have special double-length episodes, or two episodes are broadcast 
back-to-back. These are often encoded as a single file covering both episodes.

This tests that double-episode numbers are detected by the script, and that any 
common prefix only appears once in the proposed filename.

Consider the following entries taken from EpGuides.com/MyNameIsEarl:

    48     3-01      301       27/Sep/07   My Name Is Inmate 28301-016, Part 1
    49     3-02      302       27/Sep/07   My Name Is Inmate 28301-016, Part 2

A file which represents both of these episodes should probably be titled as:

    My Name Is Inmate 28301-016, Part 1 and 2

Note that numeric suffixes must not be assumed:

    34     2-10      2ALJ10    07/Dec/06   South Of The Border, Part Uno
    35     2-11      2ALJ11    07/Dec/06   South Of The Border, Part Dos

Which ought to create the title:

    South Of The Border, Part Uno and Dos
