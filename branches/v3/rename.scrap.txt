Also "use sigtrap" and "use diagnostics"
q// qq// and qx//
Also @- and @+ ($LAST_MATCH_START and $LAST_MATCH_END)
PAGE 617 for Program Generation, second trick (goes off bottom of page)

MacOS = "darwin"

Win32 = "MSWin32"

TODO:
Consider removing / refolding FILENAME PARSER & CONSTRUCT NEW FILENAME, to instead be based around the foreach loop

Generic schemes, such as $$$x€€€ for 3-digit season numbers and 2-digit episode numbers

Document .tvrenamerrc better and allow it to be tvrenamer.ini and creating files beginning with a dot isn't possible in windows explorer, tsk.

Add ability to recurse directories, i.e. run it on "D:\Series" and have it run once per directory within, D:\Series\heroes, D:\Series\Smallville etc.

Extend interactive mode to allow manually specifying the number, for those tricky situations where numbers in the dirty file name (perhaps "AC3" etc) confuse the script, or when the script simply tries to be too clever!

Add option to "make changes?" prompt to:
    Edit the changes (i.e. enter interactive mode)
    Change command-line settings and restart script (avoids overhead..) - Display a prompt, and then print the exisiting command-line to STDIN, this *ought* to put it in the user's edit line (do /not/ use cbreak mode)

Known issues:
    None ;)
