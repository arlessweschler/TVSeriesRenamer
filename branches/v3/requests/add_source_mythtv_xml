Hi Robert.

I just started using mythtv.. which rocks but really want to use the the
tvrenamer.pl so i can access my mythbox from my Media-gate.

I use the following script to update my listings and don't' use any of the
websites in your script as I live in New Zealand.

cd /tmp
rm -f latest.xml.gz latest.xml
wget http://hairy.geek.nz/epg/latest.xml.gz
gunzip latest.xml.gz
mythfilldatabase --file 1 7 latest.xml


Is there anyway for me to use these listings?

Hope you can help, thanks for putting so much work into this and giving your
time.

Cheers

Ben
New Zealand.
